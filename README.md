# BenJP-Portfolio

## Description
I created a basic landing page for my portfolio using HTML and CSS. This is a project I will continue to work on throughout my time at this boot camp. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage
On this landing page you will be greeted by my name, a small photo of me, and a navigation bar. If you click on the links in the nav bar you will be taken to the corresponding section. A small about me section. A projects section, where you can click on the photo and it will take you to the deployd application. The last one is a contact me section, where you will see my email and if you click on the LinkedIn icon it will take you to my profile.
